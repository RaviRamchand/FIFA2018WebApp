# FIFA2018WebApp 

FIFA2018WebApp is a Java EE web application that tracks and records the results of the 2018 FIFA World cup. 

The application allows the user to input a team along with their Games Played, Wins, Losses and Draws that will be then saved to the backend h2 database that will also be visible on the Display Team tab of the application. The user will then have the ability to edit, and delete the team records from the database.
